# TurtleBot3-Line-Follower
A dedicated Gazebo world with a 3 m × 3 m pentagon-shaped path was created for line following. Using URDF and ROS launch files, the robot autonomously tracked the closed loop, returned to its start point, and maintained a low lateral error of 0.1 m. RViz visualized the reference path, real-time motion, camera views, and mapping performance.
